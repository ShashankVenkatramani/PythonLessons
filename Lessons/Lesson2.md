# Python Basics Lesson 2

## Lesson Goal

The goal of this lesson is to write and run your first python program!

## Mac OS X
#### Create your text file
First open the text editor of your choice, and create a new file. The goal of this program is to print out your name, and the syntax for printint out text is
```Python
print("Anything you want to print")
```

Next go ahead and save your file, by using the top bar and going file > save as (or however your text editor has save as) and save the file as anyname.py, and remember it's location.
#### Check Python
Open terminal from spotlight search by clicking the magnifying glass on the top right, searching for terminal, and hitting enter.

Once you open up terminal, you will see a basic window, in which you can directly send commands and interface with your computer.

In order to test that you have python installed, we can run the --version command with python. In order to do so you must use the command for Python which is conveniently "python" and the --version command after to check the version. Putting them together you get "python --version"

After pressing enter and sending the computer the command it will return "Python 2.x.x" or "Python 3.x.x". If you do not see either of these, then go to python.org/download, download a python version, and redo this section.
#### Running your program

I saved my file called helloworld.py on my Desktop to make navigating to it easier.
## Windows
