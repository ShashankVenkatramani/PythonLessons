# Python Basics Lesson 1

###

The purpose of this lesson is to build an understanding as to how python works under the hood. While a thorough understanding of python is not necesary to get a running program, having an intuitive map of python internally helps understand the usage of libraries, environments, and many other aspects leveraged within python.

## Python Structure
### Syntax

Even though today's computers are able to execute highly advanced algorithms, ranging from protein fold simulations, to artificial intellegence, they are all based off of a collection of basic instructions. Unfortunately computers don't speak English, so writing instructions for your machine to understand is lengthy and inneffecient. Programming languages can be thought of as a middle man, where you can write instructions in English (with accordance to certain rules), and the programming language converts it into instructions your computer understands.

This process starts with you typing commands using the English alphabet. Even though it is in English, you must adhere to the instructions of the programming language, similar to how Spanish and English are different, so are Python and Java.

Here is an example with Python to print text:
```python
print("Hello there! Welcome to Python")
```
Here is an example with Java to print text:
```Java
System.out.println("Hello There! Welcome to Python")
```

As you can see both of Python and Java have different ways to write "Hello there! Welcome to Python"

The rules and code that you create when using any programming language is called syntax, and the syntax for each language is different, dependant upon how the developer made the programming language.

### Text Editor

In order to write code you will need a text editor.
